Hello hello, this is Luhman16, creator of this game


------Important-------
DO NOT download and execute the game if it comes from another source other than the link that is provided on my tumblr(https://www.tumblr.com/blog/luhman16). Please be aware that there is a risk in downloading anything from the internet. That game may have been modified by a bad actor, and i do not take ownership over the game if someone else has changed it without me knowing.
(What i recommend is going to read the code yourself, but i know most people dont know how to do that)

this game will only work on Windows.

All the files you need to play are in the zip file:
-RWArtMonth28.exe
-RWArtMonth28.exe.config
-RWArtMonth28.pdb
-Resources\Scenarios.xml


If you want to delete the game, simply remove all those files

Do not change the location of the files within the folder, or else the game might not work

----Customize the story/game-----
It is possible to change the scenarios for your own custom story. I made the game to be flexible so as long as you keep the same structure, you should be able to customize it.
For that, you'll need to open the "Scenarios.xml" file. look around at how its made and you can try your hand at it. it might crash but its fine lol. If you have any questions, dont hesitate to send them my way.

If you are more tech savy, i can directly give you the code, its made in C#. just contact me on tumblr (https://www.tumblr.com/blog/luhman16) and ill give you the source code.

This game was made in a day from scratch, so there might be some bugs or problems but i tried my best to do something that works!

Have fun!
