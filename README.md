## ------Important-------
DO NOT download and execute the game if it comes from another source other than the link that is provided on my tumblr(https://www.tumblr.com/blog/luhman16) or from another Github account other than Luhman-16. Please be aware that there is a risk in downloading anything from the internet. That game may have been modified by a bad actor, and i do not take ownership over the game if someone else has changed it without me knowing exactly what they changed. So download from another source at your own risk.
(What i recommend is going to read the code yourself, but i know most people dont know how to do that)

this game will only work on Windows.

All the files you need to play are in the zip file (structure is important. do not, for exemple, move the .exe file to the Resources folder):
  - RWArtMonth28.exe
  + RWArtMonth28.exe.config
  * RWArtMonth28.pdb
  - Resources\Scenarios.xml

If you want to delete the game, simply remove all those files

Do not change the location of the files within the folder, or else the game might not work

## ----Customize the story/game-----
It is possible to change the scenarios for your own custom story. I made the game to be flexible so as long as you keep the same structure, you should be able to customize it.
For that, you'll need to open the "Scenarios.xml" file. look around at how its made and you can try your hand at it. it might crash but its fine lol. If you have any questions, dont hesitate to send them my way.
If there is some demand, i can make a tutorial for how to do that.
In the future, i will work on making the character icons customisable.

If you are more tech savy, i feel free to download this code, change anything in it, port it over to another platform, all that jazz.
This game is in C#
## ----End of Customize the story/game section-----

This game was made in a day from scratch, so there might be some bugs or problems but i tried my best to do something that works!

Have fun!
